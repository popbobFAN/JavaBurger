#What is a Burger?
a burger is a fast collection for storing things you would normally have on a burger so a burger contains 10 elements called ingredients these ingredients are topBun, mustart, ketchup, onions, tomato, lettuce, cheese, patty, mayo, and bottomBun
a burger has a ingredient on it if that ingredient isnt null this allows you to have the POWERFUL ability to remove/add ingredients while iterating them
